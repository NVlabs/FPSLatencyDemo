# Web-based FPSci Latency Demo
This is a simple interactive experience intended to demonstrate the effects of added latency on first-person aiming/tracking tasks.

## Experience
The user begins by opening/reloading the page which resets the experiment state. The experiment consists of 3 states: sensitivity adjustment, latency selection, then measurement and display of results. Note that the user cannot move or jump in this experiment, just aim at/track the target.

The **sensitivity adjustment** phase allows the user to set a mouse sensitivity (and inversion if desired), using either the up/down arrow keys or a slider (press I for inversion), they prefer while familiarizing themselves with the target task (destroying a static reference target then tracking a strafing/jumping task target). 

Following this state the user enters **latency selection**, wherein they should select the *minimum* amount of latency they can detect while aiming. This can also be done using either the up/down arrow keys or a slider at the top of the window. Note that latency is added by *frame* delay so the frame rate the experiment can run at on your system will set the minimum step achievable in latency. We recommend systems that can hit at least 100 fps to run this experiment.

Finally the user enters the **measurement** state, which consists of 3 phases. In the first phase the user plays at the full latency they selected in the previous state, unless they selected a 0 or 1 frame of latency, in which case they will play at 2 frames of latency. In the next phase they play at half the latency of their first phase, an amount that should feel less/non-percetible to them. In the 3rd and final phase the user plays at the minimum system latency, which should correspond to the best perception/highest performance. Once complete a simple graphic appears showing the user the total/percentage of time they spent on target in each condition and the difference between the baseline (0 added latency) and each of the added latency conditions.

After completing the experiment the code falls back into "sandbox" mode wherein the user can modify parameters freely while adjusting system latency.

## Running the Application
The application works in a browser run from one of two modes:

* File hosted mode: Works when not using assets with the application (i.e. no local files/images requires)
* Hosted from `localhost` 

### File Hosted
To open the application in file hosted mode simply open the `index.html` page in a browser of your choice. Here all features will work *except* those that require local file contents.

### Running with Local Host
To run with local host the top-level directory for this project needs to be hosted through `localhost`. This can be done with Python using the `python -m http.server` command and a script ([`open_localhost.bat`](open_localhost.bat)) is provided to do exactly this (plus open the correct URL).

After hosting the directory through `localhost` the application can be accessed by visiting `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

## Supported Configuration
A variety of configuration from the (Windows) FPSci application is supported in this application. The application can be configured either through loading a JSON file from disk, or by using URL parameters.

Currently supported configuration is provided as a nested list below. The format is: [Parameter Name]: [`URL Parameter Name`] (`type`) = [Default Value].

Typically JSON parameter names are _very_ similar to URL parameter names, but often with less verbosity as they are inherently nested in the configuration dictionary.
